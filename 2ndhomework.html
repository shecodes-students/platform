<p>You’ll probably need 1,5 hours for this. Remember, you can speed up video playback.</p>

<ul><li>Boolean Algebra: much more complete than what we talked about</li></ul><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnQsznjccUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><ul><li><p>I have not explained what a transistor is and how it functions. It is a stunning mixture of chemistry, physics and advanced engineering:

<p>Question 1: The video shows a light going on when the sun is shining. This is stupid. What do you have to do, to make it turn on when it is dark?</p><form><textarea></textarea><input type="submit" value="check answer"></form><ul><li><p>And here is how you put millions of these into an Integrated Circuit (IC) aka “Chip” (and you will understand after watching this, why it is called a chip!) This is a comprehensive explanation directly from the inventors of the IC at Fairchild semiconductors. (it’s long, just watch the first 16 minutes)  Notice the Dual Inline Packaging (DIP), you will see it again.
